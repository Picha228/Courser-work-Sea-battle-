There are 3 game modes in Sea battle: player vs normal bot , player vs hard bot, normal bot vs hard bot.
A normal bot randomly shoots at the opponent's field, but when a ship is wounded, it tries to wound the nearest cell in order to flood the ship completely.It places ships only in random order.
Hard bot fires diagonally, guaranteeing a hit on a four-decker ship in a maximum of 24 shots, while also finding other ships. After shooting diagonally, the bot shoots randomly like normal bot.
It places ships with 3 professional arrangements or randomly.
